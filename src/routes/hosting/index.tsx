        description="Coolify is an open source platform for deploying, managing, and scaling web applications, databases, and services on your own infrastructure or in the cloud. As a self-hostable alternative to platforms like Netlify and Vercel, Coolify supports any language or framework and can deploy to any server you control, such as a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or major cloud providers, via SSH. I recommend hosting on Hetzner, and you can get a â‚¬20 free credit to get started. With Coolify, you can easily self-host databases and applications built with frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, Remix, SvelteKit, and Wordpress. With push-to-deploy Git integration, free SSL, automatic backups, and no vendor lock-in, you maintain full control over your data and costs. Coolify Cloud offers a managed control panel hosted by the Coolify team, so you do not have to maintain the dashboard yourself, but you still bring your own deployment servers. This hybrid approach gives you high availability, free email notifications, and priority support, while keeping your deployments flexible and under your control. Features like real-time monitoring, collaborative team management, and a powerful API make Coolify a robust choice for developers who want the benefits of self-hosting with less maintenance."
