It supports advanced color gamuts like P3 and Rec. 2020, and offers predictable contrast and great accessibility for palette generation. Unlike RGB or HSL, OKLCH is designed for modern CSS and always maintains color accuracy and consistency. Instantly convert between HEX, RGB, HSL, and OKLCH, and explore why OKLCH is the future of color on the web. Note that VSCode doesn't have a built-in OKLCH color preview, so you'll need to install an extension in order to see OKLCH color previews in your code. Curious about why OKLCH is recommended? See the second link at the top of this card for a deep dive into its advantages."
