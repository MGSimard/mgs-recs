        description="React's built-in state management uses hooks like useState, useReducer, and useContext to manage local and shared state. State is typically local to a component, but can be lifted up or shared via context. For centralized state management, or more complex global state management, it's generally advised to use a state management library like Zustand."

Zustand is designed to be explicit and flux-like, but avoids common pitfalls like context loss, zombie children, and React concurrency issues. Stores are easy to create and can hold any kind of state, from primitives to objects and functions. Middleware support enables features like persistence, devtools, and immutable updates."

        description="TanStack Query (formerly React Query) is the missing data fetching and server state management library for modern web apps. It makes fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating remote data in your applications simple and automatic. With built-in caching, background updates, and out-of-the-box support for mutations, TanStack Query helps you write less code, avoid async-spaghetti, and deliver a faster, more responsive user experience. Without its client-side data fetching pattern, you'll often just end up implementing a weaker version of TanStack Query. More often than not, the answer is 'Just fucking use TanStack Query'."
