        description="React's built-in state management uses hooks like useState, useReducer, and useContext to manage local and shared state. State is typically local to a component, but can be lifted up or shared via context. For centralized state management, or more complex global state management, it's generally advised to use a state management library like Zustand."

        description="Zustand is a minimalistic, fast, and scalable state management library for React. It provides a comfy, hook-based API with no need for providers or boilerplate. Zustand is designed to be explicit and flux-like, but avoids common pitfalls like context loss, zombie children, and React concurrency issues. Stores are easy to create and can hold any kind of state, from primitives to objects and functions. Middleware support enables features like persistence, devtools, and immutable updates."
