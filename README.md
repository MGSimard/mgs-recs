# MGS-Recs

_This could've been a markdown file_

## Stack

- TanStack Start (React 19, Vite, Nitro, H3, Vinxi)
- TypeScript
- Cloudflare Pages
- shadcn/ui
- TailwindCSS

Really was just looking for an excuse to try out ~~Mantine UI~~ ~~shadcn/ui~~ tailwindcss.

## Task List

- [ ] Build a card layout component for stuff
- [ ] Neon acquired by databricks
- [ ] Good info to relay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgGV5dTNu9A
- [ ] For UI libraries make sure you talk about compatibility with RSCs
- [ ] Find a category type to shove in stuff like TanStack Query
- [ ] Tailwind somewhere
- [ ] Add stylelint & stylelint-gamut
- [ ] Prettier, ESLint, that sorta stuff
- [ ] Move the nav toggle in the nav
- [ ] Add neon downtime to issues

## Other thing

- [ ] Ray.so for code screenshots
- [ ] Also make my own ray.so for markdown previews, ray.so only has the precompiled md functionality
- [ ] Same functionalities just for markdown, also toggle line number column

## HOMEWORK

- [ ] Stop putting off tRPC, try it out next fullstack project so I can decide if I recommend it or not
- [ ] Steal the hero canvas technique from https://clerk.com/ai-authentication
