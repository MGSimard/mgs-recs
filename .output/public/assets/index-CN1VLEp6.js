Unlike Plausible, which is only free for the first 30 days, PostHog provides a recurring free tier of 1 million events, 5,000 session recordings, and more every month, even on paid plans. Data can be collected via a web snippet or developer-friendly APIs, with libraries for most major languages and frameworks. PostHog supports both cloud and self-hosted deployments and offers full SQL access to your data. To avoid analytics being blocked by adblockers like uBlock Origin, you need to reverse-proxy requests through your own domain, which applies to both PostHog and Plausible. PostHog also includes features such as session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and error tracking, all integrated into a single platform. Compared to Plausible, PostHog offers broader integrations, including support for mobile and backend event capture, data warehouse imports and exports, and connections to tools like Stripe, Hubspot, S3, Zapier, and Sentry, as well as more advanced API capabilities. For GDPR compliance, PostHog offers EU-based hosting, options for cookieless tracking, and tools to help you manage user consent and data deletion. You are responsible for obtaining unambiguous consent if you collect personal data, and PostHog provides documentation and features to support secure, compliant analytics deployments.
