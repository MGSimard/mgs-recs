You are responsible for syncing payment state between Stripe and your own database, handling webhooks, and managing race conditions to avoid mismatches in subscription status. You also need to manage customer and subscription data, environment variables, price IDs, and free trials yourself. Despite these challenges, Stripe remains the industry standard for scalable, secure, and customizable payment solutions.
